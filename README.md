Financial fraud is increasing every year with the rise of new technologies and the use of mobile phones. In 2020, $32.9 billion worth of financial fraud was committed, and this is expected to rise to $40.63 billion by 2027. On the other hand, there are about 5.19 billion mobile phone users, this has had a steady growth of 2.4% over 2019, but, in the number of chips or phone numbers on average is almost 8 billion.
